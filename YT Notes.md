Hypertext markup language

Sir Tim berners-lee: Text of the future. Let’s have text that can be marked up.

If you list HTML in a list of programming languages, you’ll get run over by a car. Not a programming language — it’s a markup language.

Markup language: Markup language explains to browser what all the different sections are. You use HTML tags to do this.

H1 = #1 headline! h1-h6
P = paragraph
Img = image
Em = emphasis
a = anchor (for links)

Ppl came up with a list of what all these terms are.

You can sometimes put a tag within a tag.

"video" and footer" two of the longer tags that HTML5 is known for

<img> doesn't require a closer. Do <img src="cat.jpg">

src is an attribute — extra info you can add to a tag to make it do something else. All tags have some attributes they can share

attributes:
img needs src
a needs href. can further modify, e.g., <a target="_new" href="http://google.com">

Recommends MDN Mozilla Developer Network for HTML. w3schools is the most oldest, most establishest place to get HTML answer. Soma doesn't like them. stackoverflow isn't really for HTML — it's for more technical things. There are lists for tags. You really only need 4 HTML tags and 3 attributes.

all I do is take name of tag and type some stuff in it. maybe we'll need an attribute. Find answer in 10 seconds

CSS: Cascading Style sheets

CSS goes inside <style></style> tag.

need selector!!! You need to select stuff on page to style.

"color" is a property. "red" is a value

you can look up a list of CSS properties and values. Silicon Bay Training has a good list.

border, margin (space on each side [e.g., margin-bottom: 30px]), padding (space inside border and/or background), background

if you wanted to space things out in a special way, this is important. but to save you from memorizing these things or thinking about CSS, next up we'll learn about bootstrap.
