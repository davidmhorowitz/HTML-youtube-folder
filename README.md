I do two analyses. One compares early-career, full-time faculty salary data from the California Federation of Teachers with gross rent data from the 5-year American Community Survey, looking at what percentage of salaries at California community colleges go toward rent at the cities that the colleges are located in.

This involved using a Python PDF reader to scrape salary data from the California Federation of Teachers. I used Python to clean it, merged it with rental data from the ACS, creating a bar chart with Flourish.

Using the same data for salaries, the second analysis compares the change in salaries per year with inflation calculated from Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers to see how well salary raises keep up with inflation. The data was used to create a line graph with Flourish.
