<h1>Early-career community college teachers in the East Bay are paying nearly half of their income to rent where they teach
<h4>Their raises, on average, hardly keep up with inflation. Sometimes, they don't.  Meanwhile, California's drastic teacher shortage worsens.</h2>
<p></p>
<p><h6>By David Mamaril Horowitz</h6></p>

<p>Despite being credentialed with a master’s degree, full-time teachers with under five years of experience at East Bay community colleges must spend 45% of income on average to rent in the cities they teach, according to an analysis of salary and rent data.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bay Area — the greater region that comprises the East Bay — is well known for its housing affordability crisis, an issue that has long intersected with the U.S.’s decadeslong teacher shortage. 
</p>
<p class="indent">In California, the shortage is so drastic that nearly one-fifth of classes in the state were taught by teachers without the appropriate credentials in the 2020-21 academic year, according to the state's Teacher Assignment Monitoring Outcome data. The analysis provides a glimpse into one of the key struggles for early-career teachers in the East Bay. It uses data from the Chabot-Las Positas, Contra Costa, Ohlone and Perata community college districts collected by the California Federation of Teachers, comparing them with their respective cities’ gross rents from the American Community Survey of 2017-2021.</p>
<p class="indent">The College of Alameda was the least affordable, with rent taking up 60% of income; most affordable was Contra Costa College, with the average rent in San Pablo consuming 32% of income.</p>

<p class="indent">While these teachers get a 2.8% raise on average, after deducting 2.1% for inflation, the average raise is 0.7%, according to a second analysis that compared salary data with the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.</p>
<p class="indent">Ohlone College had the greatest raises overall, at 0.7% after deducting inflation; Peralta ranked last at -0.3%.</p>
